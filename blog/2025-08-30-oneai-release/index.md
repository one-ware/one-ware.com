The **OneAI Extension** makes creating AI models **ultra-fast**—and just as **easy**.  
You don’t need any AI expertise to get started.  

Integrated into **OneWare Studio**, it runs as a **cross-platform desktop app** that adapts to **any task, hardware, or market**.  

Every model is automatically **optimized** to run on the **smallest chips** with the **lowest power consumption**, so you can bring powerful intelligence to edge devices in no time.
