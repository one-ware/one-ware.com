Hello to a quick dev update!

## Support for Linux-Arm

We just released OneWare Studio and our OneAI Extension for the linux-arm64 platform on both [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.one_ware.OneWare) aswell as [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/oneware).

To celebrate this, I used my lunch break to create a quick **Rasperry Detection on my Rasperry Pie**.

**This demo was trained using just 14 captures from the Rasperry Pie camera, captured directly in OneWare Studio using the [camera tool](/docs/one-ai/getting-started/dataset/camera-tool/).**
