# Embedded World 2026

Join us at Embedded World Exhibition & Conference, March 10–12 in Nuremberg.

We’ll be demoing our Vision AI Wildfire Drone Demo based on Altera’s Agilex3.

Through Altera’s partner program, we’ve had access to the latest FPGA technology and are part of the ASAP program. For us, this collaboration is mainly about validating what efficient, hardware-adapted AI actually looks like in practice.

You can find us at Booth 5-329. Helmut Ploetz will also be there to walk through the technical details of the setup and answer questions.

If you’d like to schedule a meeting in advance, feel free to book a slot [here.](https://one-ware.com/docs/contact)

See you in Nuremberg.
