## ONE AI makes Vision and Edge AI fast, precise, and simple

Artificial intelligence is no longer just a trend. In industrial environments, it is **not about chatbots**, but about **application-specific AI** that is embedded directly into machines, products, and production lines.

Because even though large companies compete with ever larger AI models, anyone who wants **truly precise, fast, and energy-efficient AI** needs models that are **tailored to the specific application**.

## The efficiency dilemma of Industrial AI: **Quality, time & cost**

Optimizing AI for special applications is complex and requires not only AI expertise but also deep integration knowledge.

While many software providers promise fast AI deployment without expertise, their **pre-built models cannot cover the countless combinations of applications and hardware** found in real industrial environments.

This leads to a clear trade-off:

- The more an AI is optimized and customized,
- the closer it gets to the full potential of the dataset,
- but the higher the **development effort, time, and cost**.

As a result, many companies end up with **inefficient AI models** that:
- consume excessive resources,
- require expensive hardware,
- and still deliver inferior results.

The reason is almost always the same:  
Either the right AI architecture expertise is missing, or the development costs are simply not economically viable.

## ONE WARE resolves this conflict with ONE AI

ONE WARE addresses this optimization conflict with **ONE AI**, a **novel and patent-pending software platform**.

ONE AI is the **world’s only platform** that fully automates the generation of **custom neural network architectures**, individually tailored to:
- the application,
- the dataset,
- the target hardware,
- and the desired performance.

The entire AI development process is automated in **three steps**:

1. **Dataset and application analysis**  
   ONE AI analyzes the dataset, inspection task, and hardware constraints.
2. **Architecture prediction**  
   Based on insights from current AI research and prior optimizations, ONE AI predicts the required architecture characteristics in a single step.
3. **Automatic architecture assembly**  
   The final neural network is assembled automatically from these predicted properties.

⏱ **Total time: 0.7 seconds**

Because ONE AI can simultaneously leverage insights from numerous previous research results, the generated models are often **better than architectures developed through months of manual experimentation**.

## From model generation to real hardware deployment

The approach of ONE WARE aims to make the **entire AI development process up to productive deployment simpler and more efficient**.

Thanks to an intuitive user interface and guided workflows, AI development becomes accessible even to users **without AI expertise**.

After automatic architecture prediction, the model can be:
- trained,
- optimized,
- and exported for **any target hardware**.

To ensure reliable deployment, **ONE WARE Studio** is available as an **open-source development environment**, bridging the gap between AI models and industrial hardware.

## Practical example  
**Quality control of potato chips on Altera MAX10 FPGA**

The difference between universal AI models and ONE AI is demonstrated in a joint whitepaper by **ONE WARE and Altera**.

**Reference project using a universal AI model:**
- 88 % accuracy on test data
- Required Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano
- Insufficient speed and high energy consumption

**Results using ONE AI:**
- 99.5 % correctly detected defective chips
- **1400× higher efficiency**
- Runs on a **ten-year-old Altera MAX10 FPGA**
- Processes **1700 chips per second**

By using self-developed open-source libraries for FPGA export, latency was reduced by a factor of **488×** compared to specialized AI accelerators.

➡️ **The key insight:**  
Performance is no longer primarily defined by hardware — but by the **right AI architecture**.

## Fast and free replication

The potato chip quality control example can be replicated easily:

- The complete project is available for download on the ONE WARE website
- Includes a detailed step-by-step configuration guide
- First AI models can be trained **quickly and free of charge**

## Economic efficiency of ONE AI

The approach of ONE WARE is also designed to lower economic barriers. Working with ONE AI is cost-efficient. With sufficient free credits for AI training, there are often no costs when using the software initially. Only when a company decides to actually deploy an AI and thus gain measurable value is a usage license required. This way, companies avoid high upfront investments, as are common in traditional, individual AI development.

## Conclusion and outlook

The vision of ONE WARE is clear: AI should increase productivity — not waste resources.

This includes:
- compute and hardware resources,
- development time,
- and engineering costs.

By replacing iterative trial-and-error with **targeted architecture prediction**, ONE AI lays the foundation for **reproducibly precise, efficient, and deployable industrial AI**.
