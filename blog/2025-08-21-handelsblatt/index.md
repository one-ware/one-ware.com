## Why this matters
For us, this is a strong signal: **visibility where it matters** ‚Äî with decision-makers who expect **productive deployment** and measurable outcomes.  

Our inclusion confirms our focus on **industrial impact** and reflects exactly what ONE WARE stands for:

> **Make tailored AI radically faster, simpler, and more accessible.  
> For any task, hardware, and industry.  
> Enabling anyone to build tailored AI in seconds.**

## Industrial impact at scale
This is how companies across industries can equip their **production with AI** in a short time.  

Because our models run productively on the **smallest chips** and **low-power hardware**, we are **democratizing AI at industrial scale**.

## Perfect timing
Starting **September 1**, we will open **ONE AI** to all interested users and developers.  

- Free registration, instant training of your own AI models  
- Guided workflow with sensible defaults ‚Äî productive from day one  
- Broad hardware compatibility: **CPU, GPU, microcontrollers, and FPGAs**  
- Exported models testable on different target systems with a **30-day license**

Decision-makers can provide **ONE AI** directly to their developer teams.  
Developers can **start for free from September 1**.
