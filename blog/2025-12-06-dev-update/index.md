import someVideo from './img/prefilters.webm';

Greetings and welcome to the first of many upcoming dev updates, where I show some of the features that we have been working on lately and the exciting features that will be **released next friday**.

**This demo was created by using 25 frames from an [open-source video](https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-shot-of-the-road-in-the-middle-of-the-forest-during-winter-6640865/), extracted using our camera tool.**

## Annotation Tool Changes

To boost efficiency, we added some shortcuts to make manual labeling much faster. Also it is now possible to select or create labels on the go, much faster than before.

You can use the following hotkeys now:

**→ Key**: Next Picture<br/>
**← Key**: Previous Picture<br/>
**↓  Key**: Next Label<br/>
**↑  Key**: Previous Label<br/>
**R  Key**: Rectangel Tool<br/>
**C  Key**: Cursor (Selection Mode)

## New Training Statistics

We replaced the old plotting library with a fancy new one, check it out:

## GPU Accelerated Prefilters

Having fast and accurate Prefilters is one of our biggest priorities. Before we were struggeling with performance, which is why we always applied the prefilters to the preview only. This was working quite well but had some accuracy issues.
With update 0.8.0 we have a new System in place, swapping out the CPU Filters with Fancy GPU Rendered ones! This allows us to apply the filters with full accuracy while keeping a great performance!
