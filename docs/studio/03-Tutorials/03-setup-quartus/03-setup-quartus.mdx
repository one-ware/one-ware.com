## What is Quartus?

Quartus is a software tool produced by Intel (formerly Altera) used for the development and programming of FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) and CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) devices.
It provides a comprehensive environment for system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) design. 
Quartus includes everything needed to design, simulate, optimize, and program digital systems into Intel's line of FPGA and CPLD products.
