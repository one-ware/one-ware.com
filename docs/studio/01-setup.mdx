  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label='Linux'>

#### Using Snap (Recommended)

ONE WARE Studio is officially distributed as a Snap package in the Snap Store:<br/>

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/oneware)

You can install it by running:

```
sudo snap install --classic oneware
```

**Note:** If snap isn't available in your Linux distribution, please check the following [Installing Snapd guide](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd), which can help you get that set up.

#### Using Flatpak

Another possibility is the use of our flatpak: <br/>

[![Get it from Flathub](https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=en)](https://flathub.org/apps/com.one_ware.OneWare)

You can install it by running:

```
flatpak install flathub com.one_ware.OneWare
```

#### Manual Installation

If you can't install snap or flatpak on your machine, it is possible to download the binaries manually from [GitHub](https://github.com/one-ware/OneWare/releases) (select the .tgz version for universal linux support). Please note that as of now these binaries have no update functionality, so make sure to check for updates regularly.

:::warning MacOS Version
**The Application is not signed** yet, so it will be detected as broken by MacOS. 
You can fix this by executing the following in the terminal **after installing it to /Applications using the .dmg**.
```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine '/Applications/OneWare Studio.app'
```
