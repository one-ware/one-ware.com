# Open Source Program

## Empowering Innovation Through Open Source

At ONE WARE, we believe that the future of AI belongs to everyone. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve created our **Open Source Program** â€“ an initiative designed to support developers, researchers, and students who are building and experimenting with the next generation of AI applications using ONE AI.
