# Our AI Services at OneWare

## ONE AI Extension for ONE WARE Studio

![AI Demo](/img/studio/slides/ai.png)
Our main product, the AI extension, is currently under development. This will enable every electronics developer to create, train and integrate custom and efficient AI into the desired control system and allow AI researchers to gain insights many times faster.
Let us know if you are interested to be a beta tester for ONE AI and send us your inquiry at [info@one-ware.com](mailto:info@oneware.com).

## AI integration with personal consultation

![AI Service Demo](/img/ai/quality_dev.png)
Our personal AI integration and consultation is now available. We use our pre-release versions of ONE AI to get custom lowest latency and highest accuracy neural networks in every part of you production or product.
At the moment we start our services with the focus on quality control, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. But feel free to contact us about other applications, since ONE AI is beeing trained to accelerate AI development in each category.

#### AI-based Quality Control for Industry-Application

At OneWare, we merge technological expertise with deep industrial knowledge to create customized AI solutions that revolutionize your production processes. From initial concept to final implementation, we accompany you every step of the way, ensuring that your facilities are not only more efficient but also future-proof.

#### Products with AI Features

Want to develop a product that stands out through artificial intelligence? We support you in the conception, development, and implementation of AI features that will enhance your product offerings. Our AI models get adapted to the architecture of each logic unit to achieve maximum efficiency and performance.

#### AI-driven Condition Monitoring

Our AI solutions for condition monitoring enable real-time tracking and analysis of your systems. Whether it's identifying weeds in agricultural fields or monitoring machinery health, our AI models can detect anomalies and provide actionable insights, helping you maintain optimal operational conditions and prevent unexpected downtime.

#### Predictive Maintenance with AI

Leveraging advanced AI algorithms, our predictive maintenance solutions forecast potential failures before they occur. By analyzing historical data and real-time inputs, our AI models can predict the root causes of failures, allowing you to perform maintenance proactively, reduce downtime, and extend the lifespan of your equipment.

### Tailored to Your Needs

**Consultation and Planning**: Our experts analyze your specific needs from fast AI development, electronics design and AI integration to designing precise AI systems suitable for both existing facilities and new plans.

**Fast and Efficient Development**: Using our superior methods and tools, we develop AI solutions that can be implemented swiftly and price efficient, offering you a significant competitive edge.

**Cross-industry Expertise**: No matter in which industry your company operates, our AI systems are versatile and enhance quality control, production monitoring, and much more.

## Find the Right Hardware

We can export our AI solutions for every hardware. Currently universal C++ or Python code for processors and VHDL code for FPGAs are supported.
Our AI to VHDL converter works best at the moment with the following FPGAs:
- Altera® MAX 10
- Altera® Cyclone 10
- Altera® Cyclone V
- Altera® Agilex 7
- Altera® Agilex 5
The universal AI models can also be integrated with other frameworks like the Intel® FPGA AI Suite in your hardware.
