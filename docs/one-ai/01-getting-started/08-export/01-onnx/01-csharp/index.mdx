[OneWare.AI.Onnx](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OneWare.AI.Onnx) is a helper library to get the predicted result from a OneAI generated .onnx model, which can be used for object-detection, classification or segmentation.
The api is easy to use, has a clean architecture and is customizable.

With these few lines of code the api consumer is able to extract the OnnxOutput for further data processing:

```csharp
using SKBitmap skBitmap = SKBitmap.Decode(bitmapPath);
OnnxModel model = new(onnxModelPath);
OnnxOutput result = model.PredictOutput(skBitmap, keepSessionOpen: false);

switch (result)
{
    case OnnxRectsOutput rectsOutput:
        //further data processing
        break;
    case OnnxClassesOutput classesOutput:
        //further data processing
        break;
    case OnnxSegmentationOutput segmentationOutput:
        //further data processing
        break;
}
```

The default ```IOnnxImageProcessor``` uses SkiaSharp for extracting the data out of the image. 
Therefore, the example uses the ```SKBitmap```. This is customizable via the ```OnnxConfiguration``` 
of the ```OnnxModel```.

## Features

+ entire data processing to get the result from a OneAI generated .onnx model
+ most efficient image data extraction when using the default IOnnxImageProcessor
+ customizable through the configuration property in the ```OnnxModel```. Within this property the api consumer is e.g. able to specify
his own ```IOnnxImageProcessor``` as well as override the default ```OnnxPrediction``` for full control of data processing.
