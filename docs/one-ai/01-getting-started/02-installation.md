In this tutorial, we will guide you through the setup and installation process to get you started with ONE AI.

ONE AI consists of a cloud service and an extension for our open source software OneWare Studio. OneWare Studio runs on your local PC and is used to configure your AI project. When you are ready, the data is send to the OneWare Cloud and your model is trained on our servers. This ensures maximum performance - you don't need powerful hardware to train a model with ONE AI.

The data that you upload to the OneWare Cloud is stored securely on our own servers in germany. If you work with sensitive data, you can contact us via mail: sales@one-ware.com, so we can provide a local training service that runs on your own hardware and ensures that the data doesn't leave your company. While you use OneWare Studio, your data is stored locally on your PC until you press the ``Sync`` button in the ``Training`` tab. This means that you can already start with creating an account and configuring your settings until we can provide your local training service.

### 1. Sign Up to ONE AI
First, you need to create an account [here](https://cloud.one-ware.com/Account/Register). The registration is free and gives you access to our cloud infrastructure and AI model training.
