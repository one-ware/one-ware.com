In this tutorial, we will guide you through the setup and installation process to get you started with ONE AI.

ONE AI consists of a cloud service and an extension for our open source software OneWare Studio. OneWare Studio runs on your local PC and is used to configure your AI project. When you are ready, the data is send to the OneWare Cloud and your model is trained on our servers. This ensures maximum performance - you don't need powerful hardware to train a model with ONE AI.

The data that you upload to the OneWare Cloud is stored securely on our own servers in germany. If you work with sensitive data, you can contact us via mail: sales@one-ware.com, so we can provide a local training service that runs on your own hardware and ensures that the data doesn't leave your company. While you use OneWare Studio, your data is stored locally on your PC until you press the ``Sync`` button in the ``Training`` tab. This means that you can already start with creating an account and configuring your settings until we can provide your local training service.

## 1. Download and install OneWare Studio
First, you need to install OneWare Studio on your PC.

#### Using Snap (Recommended)

ONE WARE Studio is officially distributed as a Snap package in the Snap Store:<br/>

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/oneware)

You can install it by running:

```
sudo snap install --classic oneware
```

**Note:** If snap isn't available in your Linux distribution, please check the following [Installing Snapd guide](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd), which can help you get that set up.

#### Using Flatpak

Another possibility is the use of our flatpak: <br/>

[![Get it from Flathub](https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=en)](https://flathub.org/apps/com.one_ware.OneWare)

You can install it by running:

```
flatpak install flathub com.one_ware.OneWare
```

#### Manual Installation

If you can't install snap or flatpak on your machine, it is possible to download the binaries manually from [GitHub](https://github.com/one-ware/OneWare/releases) (select the .tgz version for universal linux support). Please note that as of now these binaries have no update functionality, so make sure to check for updates regularly.

```

### Adding additional extensions
OneWare Studio is open source and has multiple extensions that allow you to use it as development platform for any kind of AI, software, firmware or FPGA development. Click on ``Extras`` > ``Extensions`` to open the ``Extension Manager`` that lets you personalize OneWare Studio for your development needs.

### Adding hardware support
If you want to create an AI model for a specific hardware, ONE AI needs to know the technical details of that hardware to optimize the model for the available resources. You can [define the hardware resources yourself](/docs/one-ai/getting-started/hardware-settings), but we also offer existing configurations for a growing list of hardware. You can install additional configuration files in the ``Extension Manager`` under ``Hardware`` > ``OneAI Support``.

![hardware extensions](/img/ai/one_ai_plugin/getting_started/installation/hardware_extensions.png)

If there isn't an extension for your hardware, you can contact us at info@one-ware.com, so we know which hardware to add next.

## 3. Sign up to ONE AI
Next, you need to create an account [here](https://cloud.one-ware.com/Account/Register). The registration is free and gives you access to our cloud infrastructure and AI model training.
