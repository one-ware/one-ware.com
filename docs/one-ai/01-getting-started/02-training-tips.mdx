## What kind of AI models can I build with ONE AI?
Currently, ONE AI can create models that solve various computer vision tasks. You can work on audio or time series data as well, by converting it to a visual representation with OneWare Studio's ``Spectrogram Generator``. We are planning to add models that work directly on time series data in the future.

The supported computer vision tasks are:
- Image Classification: assigning categories that apply to the entire image (e.g. *defective* vs. *non-defective*)
- Object Detection: identifying and locating multiple objects within an image (e.g. detecting objects on an assembly line)
- Semantic Segmentation (coming soon): assigning a class label to each pixel in the image (e.g. marking different tissue types in medical images)

## Create your first AI project
The first step to creating your own AI model is to create a new project in OneWare Studio. To do so you need to click on ``AI`` in the menu bar and select ``Open AI Generator``.

## Load your dataset
- Only explain dataset import, reference full guide for other options
- Mention how to use reference images

## Add filters to process your images
- Try minimizing unnecessary information:
  - Crop
  - Resize
  - Grayscale + Channel Filter
- Make it easier to focus on relevant parts:
  - Contrast
  - Brightness
  - Frequency Filter

## Add augmentations to increase dataset size
- Adds diversity to your dataset
- Helps to prevent overfitting
- Don't do augmentations that don't make sense for your application (e.g. flipping)

## Provide context for your application

## Train your model

## Test and export your model
