## Find the Right Hardware

The ONE AI extension can export the created AI for every hardware. If you are satisfied with the results, you can export the AI as cross-platform executable, universal HDL code, C++ project or ONNX/TF/TF-Lite Model.

For our AI-to-HDL converter, we tested the following FPGAs to optimize performance:
- Altera® MAX 10
- Altera® Cyclone 10
- Altera® Cyclone V
- Altera® Agilex 7
- Altera® Agilex 5
- Altera® Agilex 3

If you want to be more flexible with the AI architecture, you can export the created AI model as TF-Lite or ONNX. Then with the Altera® FPGA AI Suite you can integrate these bigger and more complex AI models aswell into your FPGA.
