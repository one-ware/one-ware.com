## AI from Idea to Integration

Our main product, the **ONE AI extension for ONE WARE Studio**, enables every developer to create, train, and integrate efficient AI models directly into the desired hardware. This way, AI researchers can gain insights many times faster and product developers can quickly move from idea to implementation.

The extension is designed to be intuitive and accessible. With **online tutorials** and **in-software hints**, we help you get started smoothly. And if you run into challenges, our specialists are ready to support you personally.
