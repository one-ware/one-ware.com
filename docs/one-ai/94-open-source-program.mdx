# Open Source Program

## Empowering Open-Source Innovation

At ONE WARE, we believe that the future of AI belongs to everyone. The **Open Source Program** supports **non-commercial open source, academic, and research initiatives** that explore and prototype with ONE AI.

## How It Works

1. **Submit Your Idea**  
   Email **[info@one-ware.com](mailto:info@one-ware.com)** with:
   - A short description of your non-commercial project or repository  
   - Optional: links to docs, code, or relevant materials

2. **Request a Grant**  
   Tell us how many credits/minutes of AI training would help your **non-commercial** work.

3. **Receive Free Credits (if approved)**  
   If approved, you’ll receive a **voluntary, non-binding grant** of free credits for AI training.  
   *Note: Credits under this program are provided at our discretion and without legal entitlement.*

4. **Build & Explore**  
   Use ONE AI to prototype, test concepts, and explore ideas **in a non-commercial setting**.

5. **Ask for More (optional)**  
   Need additional credits later? Reach out again—we may extend your grant.
