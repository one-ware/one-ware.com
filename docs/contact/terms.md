# General Terms and Conditions ONE WARE – ONE AI

ONE WARE has developed the ONE AI software solution (hereinafter referred to as the "Software") which aims to increase the efficiency and performance of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal is to train specific AI models for various subject areas at the request of customers. For this purpose, customers can upload and edit content, in particular images, and use it to train an AI model. ONE WARE uses this data to optimize the models according to the customer's wishes and adapt them to the respective requirements and topics. This creates a customized AI solution that meets the specific needs of the customer. 

With this in mind, the parties agree as follows:

3. By completing the registration process, the customer submits a legally binding request to ONE WARE to conclude a contract. ONE WARE will send the customer confirmation of receipt of the offer to the email address provided by the customer during registration immediately after receipt of the offer by ONE WARE. However, this confirmation does not constitute acceptance of the customer's offer. 
3. A contract between ONE WARE and the customer is only concluded when ONE WARE has accepted the offer. The customer will receive the declaration of acceptance either by email or by being provided with access to the software ("conclusion of contract").

The customer can edit and organize this training data set in order to prepare the training of the AI model in the best possible way. In particular, the customer can classify the images, mark relevant areas, and use pre-filters (e.g., color enhancement, focus, cropping). In addition, the customer can already make default settings for the AI model they want and, if necessary, select and define the hardware resources on which the model is to run later.  

3. Once the customer has prepared their training data accordingly and made all necessary model and hardware settings, the customer can start the **training** and have it carried out by ONE WARE in return for payment of the remuneration ("Credits") described in Section [ 5 ](#_page4_x68.00_y548.04)and in the Pricing Annex contained in Appendix 3. To do this, they upload the training data to the ONE AI Cloud. The customer can individually determine the start, time, and scope of the training. 
4. After completing the training, the customer has the option of testing the AI model ("testing"). To do this, the customer can view how the AI model classifies data on the ONE AI Extension. The customer can also upload new data sets to evaluate whether the AI model works for the desired application. The customer also has the option of obtaining a test license for the AI model to test whether the AI model works on the respective hardware ("hardware test"). The customer can select this option by clicking on the "Export" button. Details on testing and, in particular, the hardware test are set out in Section [8 ](#_page7_x68.00_y140.04).
