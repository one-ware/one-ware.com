## What kind of AI models can you build?

Currently, ONE AI can create models that solve various computer vision tasks:

- **Image Classification**: assigning categories to entire images (e.g. *defective* vs. *non-defective*)
- **Object Detection**: identifying and locating multiple objects within an image (e.g. detecting objects on an assembly line)
- **Semantic Segmentation** (coming soon): assigning a class label to each pixel in the image

You can also work on audio or time series data by converting it to a visual representation with ONE WARE Studio's ``Spectrogram Generator``.

## Create an AI Project

To create a new AI project in ONE WARE Studio, click ``AI`` in the menu bar and select ``Open AI Generator``.

</div>

## Load Your Dataset

To load your images into ONE WARE Studio, go to the ``Dataset`` tab in your ONE AI workspace. At the top-right is a button that allows you to import your data. You can:

- Load unlabeled images
- Import an existing labeled dataset
- Use the built-in ``Camera Tool`` to record a dataset with a connected camera

</div>

:::tip Using reference images
You can provide reference images to give additional context on how your objects should look. For example, if you want to detect defects on a product, you can provide images of non-defective product as a reference. Learn more in [this tutorial](/docs/tutorials/difference-image-demo).

## Add Filters to Process Images

Use filters to prepare your images for training. To get the best results, try to simplify images as much as possible while keeping all relevant information.

Useful filters:
- **Resolution Filter**: Reduce image size to the minimum that keeps important details visible
- **Crop Filter**: Crop images to the region of interest
- **Color Filter**: Adjust contrast, brightness, or convert to grayscale
- **Channel Filter**: Keep only specific color channels

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
    <img src="/img/ai/one_ai_plugin/getting_started/filter_resolution_10.png" alt="Resolution Filter" style={{ width: '30%' }} />
    <img src="/img/ai/one_ai_plugin/getting_started/filter_color_1.png" alt="Color Filter" style={{ width: '30%' }} />
</div>

## Add Augmentations

Data augmentation artificially increases your dataset size by applying random transformations to images during training. This helps improve performance and prevent overfitting, especially with small datasets.

The default augmentations are a good starting point, but tune them to your specific application. Not all augmentations suit every use case - for example, if detecting text or labels, flipping images doesn't make sense.

## Start Training

Once your dataset is ready and filters are configured, you can start training:

1. Go to the ``Training`` tab
2. Click ``Sync`` to connect to OneWare Cloud
3. Click ``Create Model``
4. Click ``Train`` to start training

The training process will run on our cloud servers. You'll see progress updates and can download your model when training completes.
