#### Using Snap (Recommended)

ONE WARE Studio is officially distributed as a Snap package in the Snap Store:

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/oneware)

You can install it by running:

```
sudo snap install --classic oneware
```

**Note:** If snap isn't available in your Linux distribution, please check the following [Installing Snapd guide](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd), which can help you get that set up.

#### Using Flatpak

Another possibility is the use of our flatpak:

[![Get it from Flathub](https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=en)](https://flathub.org/apps/com.one_ware.OneWare)

You can install it by running:

```
flatpak install flathub com.one_ware.OneWare
```

#### Manual Installation

If you can't install snap or flatpak on your machine, it is possible to download the binaries manually from [GitHub](https://github.com/one-ware/OneWare/releases) (select the .tgz version for universal linux support). Please note that as of now these binaries have no update functionality, so make sure to check for updates regularly.

### Adding hardware support

If you want to create an AI model for specific hardware, ONE AI needs to know the technical details to optimize the model for available resources. You can [define hardware resources yourself](/docs/reference/hardware-settings), but we also offer existing configurations for a growing list of hardware.

You can install additional hardware configurations in the ``Extension Manager`` (``Extras`` > ``Extensions`` > ``Hardware`` > ``OneAI Support``).

![hardware extensions](/img/ai/one_ai_plugin/getting_started/installation/hardware_extensions.png)

If there isn't an extension for your hardware, contact us at info@one-ware.com.

## Data Privacy

ONE AI consists of a cloud service and a desktop extension. Your data is stored locally on your PC until you press the ``Sync`` button in the ``Training`` tab. When you're ready, data is sent to OneWare Cloud and your model is trained on our servers in Germany.

If you work with sensitive data, contact us at sales@one-ware.com for a local training service that runs on your own hardware and ensures data doesn't leave your company.

## Next Steps

You're all set! Continue to [your first project](/docs/get-started/first-project) to train your first AI model.
