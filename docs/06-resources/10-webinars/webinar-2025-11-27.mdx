## Your task
For the second part of the webinar, you will build an AI Quality Control system using One AI.

1. **Set up OneWare Studio**: Follow the instructions in our [setup guide](/docs/get-started/installation) to install OneWare Studio, the OneAI extension and to create an account.
2. **Download the exercise dataset**
3. **Create a new project** by clicking on ``AI`` > ``OneAI Project Generator``
4. **Import the exercise dataset** as a COCO dataset. You can check whether the import was successful by clicking on one of the images and checking the annotations.
5. **Set up the dataset splits**:
    - The dataset doesn't contain a validation split, so we leave the default settings for creating one turned on.
    - We do have a test split, so we turn off the option to create a test split.
6. **Set up filters and augmentations**: The default settings will already create a good starting point, but we can improve the model by tuning the filters and augmentations to our application.
7. **Configure the model settings**: provide additional information about the application to obtain the best possible model.
8. **Train the model** for 5 minutes.
9. **Test the model** and look for cases where the performance can be improved.
